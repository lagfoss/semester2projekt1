        <h2>What is VR lIFE</h2>
        <p> <b> <em> VR LIFE is a brand new revolutionary system where you can test your skills
          within the range of giving first aid.
          You’re able to test your reaction in various scenarios before you risk experiencing something similar in real life.
          This way, you’ll feel more confident, secure and ready if you’re in the
          future put in a situation where first aid is needed.</em></b><br><br>
          <b>With VR LIFE you can test what you would do in scenarios like:</b><br>
-	A man collapses in the middle of the street, his head turns blue and he suddenly stops breathing.<br>
-	Opening a door only to be greeted by a room that’s filled with smoke, open windows, flames from the kitchen,
and the person you love the most is laying unconscious on the floor, filled with second degree burns.<br>
-	A car has crashed into another, one driver is stuck and can’t get out while the car has started to fill up with smoke.
 The other driver is slowly crawling out of his vehicle covered in his own blood.<br><br>

<b>Not only that,</b> but you’ll also be able to <b>test your instinct</b> of which order you’ll be
giving first aid and thereby also <b>learn the proper order</b> to do things in.<br><br>

Studies have shown that barely <b>4 out of 5 Danish drivers</b> doesn’t know how to <b>properly
examine</b> someone who’s injured and about <b>7 out of 10</b> doesn’t know to <b>properly give CPR at a cardiac arrest.</b><br>
Studies have also shown that the best way to learn is through <b>practical and emotional experience. </b><br><br>
<b><em>VR LIFE will help you train and remember your skills in first aid, so that you know exactly what to do
  in which order when you have the chance of saving another person’s life.</em></b>
